# Intro

Welcome to the SriptGuru docs!

The goal of this project is simple: document as much of GameGuru's Lua API as we can to help creators build the games they want. :raised_hands:

ScriptGuru is, and probably will be as long as GameGuru is under active development, a work in progress. If you have experience with GameGuru and are interested in contributing, we welcome pull requests on GitHub.

::: warning INTENTIONALLY UNDOCUMENTED
There are some parts of the GameGuru Lua API that are left intentionally undocumented. This is either because we considered the functionality internal or out of scope of this project. Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/davismcphee/script-guru/issues) if you think we should include some currently undocumented functionality.
